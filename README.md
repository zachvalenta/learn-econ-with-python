> Iâ€™ve been warning for a couple years now that the national debt was about to become a problem again. For two decades, Americans didnâ€™t worry much about the debt, because interest rates were low. If interest payments are low, you basically donâ€™t even notice debt piling up, because it doesnâ€™t do anything â€” it just sort of sits there as a number in Microsoft Excel.

> But when rates go up, you have to start rolling over your debt at those higher rates. When a 10-year Treasury bond matures, the government has to go out and borrow more money in order to pay the principal on that bond. So the interest it pays on that little slice of debt immediately jumps from whatever the rate was on the old Treasury bond to whatever the Treasury rate is today. If rates are higher today than when the old bond got issued, then thereâ€™s a sudden jump in the federal governmentâ€™s monthly interest payments.

> Thatâ€™s happening to the U.S. right now, and itâ€™s happening fast. Interest rates started going up three years ago, and the average maturity of the national debt is about 6 years. Every day, more of that debt is rolled over at the new higher rate of over 4%, and the governmentâ€™s interest costs go up and up.
